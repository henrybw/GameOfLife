*(I wrote this back in fall 2008, during my freshman year of college)*

A project that kind of spawned from a whim, I remember one day thinking, "Hey, why is my screensaver one of the default OS X screensavers? I should make my own and make it do something cool!" Well, what would be a cool screensaver? The Game of Life.

Now, this may have been done many times before, but my version incorporates the "fading" feature from Mirek's Java Cellebration, which I haven't seen (yet) in an OS X Game of Life screensaver. In other words, the cells fade out over time, which, at 12 generations per second, looks pretty darned snazzy.
